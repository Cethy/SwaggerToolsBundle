# Cethyworks\SwaggerToolsBundle

Development tools for [kleijnweb/swagger-bundle](https://github.com/kleijnweb/swagger-bundle)

Doctrine entities, controllers & access-control file generators based on Swagger documents.

## Install 

```sh
$ composer require cethyworks-swagger-tools-bundle
```

*Needs kleijnweb/swagger-bundle to be configured.*

## Commands

### Doctrine Entities Generator

```sh
$ app/console swagger:generate:entities swagger.yml HelloApiBundle
```

This command auto-generate doctrine entities based on Swagger file resource definitions.

The resulting entities contains the right `@ORM\` & `@Assert\` (@see Supported Swagger Properties below).

#### Relations

Since the Swagger specification don't give us the possibility to describe the entity relation (and it's not its work), you can provide a additional yml document path (starting from the swagger document directory) in order to do that. This is the format :

```yml
entities:
  Foo: ~ <- no relations
  Fool: ~
  Bar:
    foo: many2one <- Bar many2one unidirectional Foo
    baz: <- Bar many2one bidirectional Baz
      type: many2one
      inversedBy: bars
  Baz:
    bars: <- Baz one2many bidirectional Bar
      type: one2many
      mappedBy: baz
```

Currently, the generator care only about the `inversedBy` & `mappedBy` keys, and **does not handle many2many relations**.


See `swagger:generate:entities --help` for more details.


### Controllers Generator

```sh
$ app/console swagger:generate:controllers swagger.yml HelloApiBundle
```

This command auto-generate Controller classes (and corresponding ControllerTest classes) based on the Swagger file paths definitions and register them as services (as needed by `kleijnweb/swagger-bundle`).

The resultant classes contains all the methods declared and matches the routing generated by `kleijnweb/swagger-bundle`.

**How it works (internal behavior) :**

- lists sf2 routes (needs SwaggerBundle working)
- extracts `^swagger.{documentName}.{resource}.*.{action}$` from routes
- build `{resource}Controller.php` with `{action(s)}` methods
- register `swagger.controller.{resource}` service


See `swagger:generate:controllers --help` for more details.


### Role Based Access Control Configuration Generator

```sh
$ app/console swagger:generate:access-control swagger.yml HelloApiBundle
```

This command auto-generate access-control configuration files based on the Swagger file paths/security definitions and register them in `config/security.yml`.

See `swagger:generate:access-control --help` for more details.


### Supported Swagger Properties
- readOnly
- required (Assert)
- minLength/maxLength (Assert)
- minimum/maximum (Assert)
- minItems/maxItems (Assert)
- enum (Assert)
- type (Assert)
- pattern (Assert)
- format{date\*,date-time\*,email,uuid,url, custom\*} (Assert)

#### Note on format :
Swagger allow any string as format's value, Use it to add your custom Constraints.

example : `format: "AppBundle\Validator\Constraints\MyCustomConstraint"`

### Todo
- Update composer.json when kleijnweb/swagger-bundle PR is accepted 
- Handle many2many relations
