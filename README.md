# Cethyworks\SwaggerToolsBundle

Development tools for [kleijnweb/swagger-bundle](https://github.com/kleijnweb/swagger-bundle)

Doctrine entities, controllers & access-control file generators based on Swagger documents.

## Install 

```sh
$ composer require cethyworks-swagger-tools-bundle
```

*Needs kleijnweb/swagger-bundle to be configured.*

## Commands

### Doctrine Entities Generator

```sh
$ app/console swagger:generate:entities swagger.yml HelloApiBundle
```

This command auto-generate doctrine entities based on Swagger file resource definitions.

The resulting entities contains the right `@ORM\` & `@Assert\` (@see Supported Swagger Properties below).

See `swagger:generate:entities --help` for more details.


### Controllers Generator

```sh
$ app/console swagger:generate:controllers swagger.yml HelloApiBundle
```

This command auto-generate Controller classes (and corresponding ControllerTest classes) based on the Swagger file paths definitions and register them as services (as needed by `kleijnweb/swagger-bundle`).

The resultant classes contains all the methods declared and matches the routing generated by `kleijnweb/swagger-bundle`.

**How it works (internal behavior) :**

- lists sf2 routes (needs SwaggerBundle working)
- extracts `^swagger.{documentName}.{resource}.*.{action}$` from routes
- build `{resource}Controller.php` with `{action(s)}` methods
- register `swagger.controller.{resource}` service


See `swagger:generate:controllers --help` for more details.


### Role Based Access Control Configuration Generator

```sh
$ app/console swagger:generate:access-control swagger.yml HelloApiBundle
```

This command auto-generate access-control configuration files based on the Swagger file paths/security definitions and register them in `config/security.yml`.

See `swagger:generate:access-control --help` for more details.
